My first "Hello World" repository.

Hello viewers!

My name is Yuxiang Fan, and I prefer Sean for convenience. I am currently studying data science relative knowledge, and trying to create my own GitHub for sharing all my project. I am completely a rookie to this field, and please feel free to correct me if I made any stupid mistake. lol
